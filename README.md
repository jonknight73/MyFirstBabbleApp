# My First Babble App

This project of the code supporting a [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) that takes you step by step through building a minimal app using [the Babble Android library](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble-android). Babble Android is an implementation of [Babble](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/babble) for mobile Android Devices. It provides a mechanism for mobile devices to reach a consensus. 

The app is a random number generator, where all peers will agree on the correct order of the random numbers. It is intended as a minimal implementation that can be easily adapted for other projects.
